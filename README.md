# Network_pcap
Network analysis using Wireshark. I initiated an attack on the target machine (Ubuntu) using Kali Linux, while Wireshark was used to analyze packets transmitted to and from the Ubuntu IP address. The captured packet was filtered accordingly to the target IP to focus on relevant traffic, followed by a detailed examination of communication patterns, payloads, and protocols.
